**Q: Who inspired you to start making 3D art-related content?**

A: People like Hapico, Blue Monkey, and many more animators inspire me to keep going with animation because it's something I really enjoy!



**Q: What software do you use?**

A: I use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for all of my 3D work! It's free and a great way to start your 3D journey. I highly recommend [Blender Guru's Donut Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD) for beginners.

  

**Q: When did you start making 3D art?**

A: I started making 3D art in Blender when I was about 9 years old, and I am now 14! I started off making Roblox renders and then gradually got into making Minecraft things and I stuck with it.

  

**Q: How did you learn to use Blender?**

A: I actually managed to teach myself how to use it when I first started out, which is a very dumb thing to do when you are starting in a program like Blender. Trust me, just follow tutorials.. it'll make the learning experience much better.

  

**Q: Can I join your team? / Can you join my team?**

A: I am not interested in working with any more teams at the moment.

  

**Q: Can you make me a free render?**

A: No thanks. I don't take requests right now and my commissions are closed. Sorry!

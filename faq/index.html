                <p><strong>Q: Who inspired you to start making 3D art-related content?</strong></p>
                <p>A: People like Hapico, Blue Monkey, and many more animators inspire me to keep going with animation because it's something I really enjoy!</p>

                <p><strong>Q: What software do you use?</strong></p>
                <p>A:  I use <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender</a> for all of my 3D work! It's free and a great way to start your 3D journey. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw&list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD" target="_blank">Blender Guru's Donut Tutorial</a> for beginners.  </p>

                <p><strong>Q: When did you start making 3D art?</strong></p>
                <p>A: I started making 3D art in Blender when I was about 9 years old, and I am now 14! I started off making Roblox renders and then gradually got into making Minecraft things and I stuck with it. </p>

                <p><strong>Q: How did you learn to use Blender?</strong></p>
                <p>A:  I actually managed to teach myself how to use it when I first started out, which is a very dumb thing to do when you are starting in a program like Blender. Trust me, just follow tutorials.. it'll make the learning experience much better.</p>
